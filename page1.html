	<h2>How To Play Valorant?</h2>
	<p>Each match has two teams of five players. Before a match begins, every player selects a character (called an
		Agent) with a unique set of abilities. Each team can only have one of each Agent. Matches have rounds, and the
		first team to win 13 rounds wins the match.

		One team starts as the Attackers and one team starts as the Defenders, and after 12 rounds, the two teams switch
		sides. The Attackers’ goal is to plant a bomb (called the Spike) on one of several bomb sites around the map.
		The Defenders’ job is to, well, defend, either by defusing the Spike after it’s planted, or preventing the
		Attackers from planting the Spike within the round’s time limit. Either team can also win a round by eliminating
		the other team, as there are no respawns during a round.

	<h2>Agents</h2>
	<p>Valorant has 18 agents in the game currently and are going to be releasing more. Valorant has a number of heroes
		to choose from. These are so-called "Agents" with special abilities that make for different playstyles.

		Choosing between heroes, meanwhile, is tactical but not as massive as the differences in something like
		Overwatch.
		All of Valorant's agents have the same health and hitboxes, making it all about their abilities. These include
		powers that can blind opponents, or block out an area with fire for a time, or use radar to see if enemies are
		nearby.

		Each ability is assigned to a different (Q, E, C and X) and require charging. Some you can purchase at the buy
		stage, others you have to earn enough points to use.

		A character's ultimate ability is activated by pressing X by default. This special move is most effective but
		also requires kills or orbs (you'll find these around the map) to power up so it takes a while to earn.</p>

	<h2>More Info</h2>
	<p>Blend your style and experience on a global, competitive stage. You have 13 rounds to attack and defend your side
		using sharp gunplay and tactical abilities. And, with one life per-round, you'll need to think faster than your
		opponent if you want to survive. Take on foes across Competitive and Unranked modes as well as Deathmatch and
		Spike Rush.
